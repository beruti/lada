    paragraphsPartA: [
      { content: 'We take a cab across London in the early Thursday morning darkness and make our flight to Estonia. On arrival, we rush over to a lot near Tallinn airport recommended by the rally’s organisers. With a meagre budget of just 750 euros, a graveyard of broken windscreens, punctured tyres and unregistered vehicles awaited us. But in this rough, past a dozen deformed hatchbacks and a promising people carrier, lay our diamond: a crusty black BMW 3 series with a chassis so low to the ground that not even the lithest limbo dancer could make it under the thing. The vehicle had been personally resurrected from a scrapheap by the garage owner’s lackey, who’d installed strobe headlights and filled the boot with the spoils of fishing trips. Critically, he’d removed the suspension and as a result each bump in the road became a symbol of sabotage, threatening wanton destruction of the undercarriage. A few late arrivals were circling though, eyeing up our car, and with time running out we said our prayers and sealed the deal on our mobile home to-be. From one Saturday to the next this vehicle had to carry the three of us, feckless mechanics toting a dummies’ guide to auto-repair, from coast to coast: from Tallinn in Estonia to Thessaloniki in Greece. As we left the garage another team were huddled around their newly purchased Mercedes E Class, trying to patch a leak, as its engine retched up a flow of coolant onto the tarmac.' },
      { content: 'It\'s Saturday morning and the sky is an anti-climactic grey. We congratulate ourselves for having made it to the starting point, taking our position amongst the potholes in an unassuming carpark near the south side of Tallinn\'s ring road. Nine other cracked-up cars are parked bumper-to-bumper, their newly minted numberplates shimmering as each owner lovingly applies racing stripes and whispers final blessings to the engines. The final team, a little flustered, splutter into the lot in a golden VW Passat. In the three mile stretch from here to the city center, they\'ve already already had to ask for a jump start. With a bang, a people carrier careens, donuts and nearly flips itself before bursting out of the \"starting gates\" and onto the Estonian equivalent of the M4, outbound one-way, first-stop Latvia. '},
      { content: 'If all went to plan, fifty solid hours of driving lay ahead as we set off from that carpark. Looking on a map, with a big cross through Russia, a decision would be needed as we came to the bottom of Poland. We could either go left, through the patchwork quilt of countries behind the Tatra mountains on the Polish-Slovakian border or go right, also encountering the Carpathian mountain range but navigating the bulks of Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria before ending in Greece.'},
      { content: 'Before the trip, my expectations had been set high by a book by Patrick Leigh Fermour, the biography of a teen Englishman walking from England to Istanbul in a time before the First World War. Each page helped gloss over our use of Google Maps with a romantic patina. I imagined the Habsburg high life; counts would invite us into their castles and hospitable shepherds bid us to shelter in their huts. In contrast to this idyll were stories from a book tracing European history at the dawn of the EU’s creation; - stories from the Second World and Yugoslavian War, and anecdotes from Tom about the copious amount of vicious stray dogs in rural Romania. On a recent trip he’d been handed a homemade club to carry at all times.'},
      { content: 'We enjoyed a meal in the dark that first evening, eating delicious, indiscernible food at a place we had somehow arrived at after muffled phone calls and reference from a potential host’s friend-of-a-friend. Coming up the drive we peered in through the glass of the nearest building to find a wedding in full swing, its audience rapt, listening in silence to speeches. Sneaking around the back of the building in search of our host we instead bumped into the apron-clad catering staff of the event. After minor explanation of our appearance a makeshift table was erected and we were brought steaming hot plates from the wedding’s menu, the hospitality even extending to a two litre bottle of an apple-mint juice I won’t be recommending.' },
      { content: 'We breathed a few short sighs of relief in the night air of Northern Poland, a show of solemnity after our day’s drive. We’d made good progress, blitzing three countries in a single day, but the way the beamer had handled had certainly given us pause for thought. The car aquaplaned several times on the sodden roads of Lithuania and in the downpour earlier that afternoon we had been slung unannounced into the oncoming traffic of a roundabout. Without time to press the horn we could but stare exasperated and wide-eyed at the approaching driver; yet only an expressionless old face peered back at us from behind the steering wheel as we skid out the nearest exit, the tyres somehow finding a newly poignant traction on the wet road.' },
      { content: 'At sunrise, people were still dancing in the morning mist. We snuck out as they went to bed and plucked a few apples from the roadside before settling back into the car. Driving through the small and empty town nearby, we recognised one of the catering staff who had kindly served us the night before. In the next village, we swapped Zloty for some yogurt and drank hastily from the pot. Several ornate church spires passed us by before we left the town behind and started out on another big day of driving; roads undulated through fields dotted with cows before turning into unworn tarmac tracks through regimented woodland. The car seemed thankful for the dry smooth roads. The rest of Poland passed slowly; with heavy rainfall and an unreliable set of tyres we stuck to the motorways, avoiding major cities and high speeds, the aquaplaning of the day before fresh in our minds.' },
      { content: 'It was still raining as we approached the valleys of Slovakia. Abandoned by skiers for the season, the locals met us with mixed emotions. We dug into more rich, hard-to-classify food: dumplings doused in gravy, a potato outer housing pockets of tender pork meat. Bells clanged loudly in the pastures as cows grazed and hay stacks loomed ominously: spaced out, stale grass, standing tall as people in the fields, unlike the tightly wrapped, neat cylinders from the fields of home. We crossed back over the Polish border in search of petrol and what is known as the “Eye of the Sea” - a series of highland lakes called Morskie Oko, which we were naive enough to think we could drive up to. Grateful for the lack of rain, the brisk swim and cup of borscht that awaited us at the top, after 4 hours of hiking we arrived back at the car.' },
      { content: 'Soon the peaks of the Tatra mountains were silhouetted by the last of the sunlight, framed in the plastic-glass side mirror as we drove onto the flatlands of Slovakia and the enveloping evening darkness of Hungary. Beside the Slovakian motorway sat a vast off-white castle, towering over the landscape in the twilight. With its semi-literal ivory towers dwarfing the town, it was hard not to project a mental image-reel of medieval and knightly scenes, a romantic idea in contrast to the feudal history of the surroundings.' },
      { content: 'I tried out my camcorder a little more in Hungary. On a morning walk alone, I filmed flowers on roadside bushes and the warm morning light bathing the buildings, an old lady ambling through a residential neighbourhood. Zooming in on an orchid in someone’s window, a curtain is abruptly drawn back and a topless man starts wildly gesticulating at me. He swings his arms manically through the air, throwing Hungarian syllables over his barbed wire fence before I put the camera away, failing to record any of it. Back at the homestay, the Ladies Youth Olympic boxing was on and a young Hungarian lady is battering her opponent. We hit the road.'},
      { content: 'All countries mentioned so far are members of the Schengen agreement. This means there is freedom of movement, no stop-and-checks just smooth sailing over land that to the unknowing eye looks quite the same. This also means that we were yet to whip out our passports or fret over any border forces who might inform us the car we had bought hastily, at such a good price, was stolen or even that its hubcaps were stuffed with heroin. All these paranoiac thoughts now surfaced as we approached the Serbian border, our first hard stop. Uneventfully, neither the Hungarian or Serbian border force questioned our modus operandi.'},
      { content: 'Following a recommendation for a place to swim we pulled up to a lakeside. Thick-green algae bunched at the surface, shiny in the midday sun. Young boys ran on concrete paths, chasing each other around the lake\’s uneven circumference and a few rowing boats chugged along its turgid surface. Maybe we’d swim after lunch instead. We finally finished the jar of “pattisons” - ridged-oval and lurid-white pickles - that had been sloshing around on every turned corner with us since Estonia. For the rest of the day we cruised pretty steadily through flat, yellow pastures, botching overtakes of lorries on single track main roads until we met sudden urbanity once again. We crossed the river of Novi Sad on a precarious wrought iron bridge.'},
      { content: 'The \“Balkan Retreat\” is nestled in the Fruška Gora National Park, tucked behind hills and surrounded by forest. So we were a little bemused when we called to find a female host from South-East London on the other end of the phone. She told us of a town nearby to grab some supplies. Before arriving and missing the first turning, we circled back on the town of Beocin. We drove in parallel to a large cement factory, up a quiet, straight road. To our left, people in crumbling houses left their doors ajar. Men played cards and drank at a table in the humid open air by the corner shop. The buildings were all a dusty pink. The dying light outlined half-functioning silos and cement mills before we met the darkness of the national park and quickly took a wrong turn.'},
      {content: 'There was a fire in the middle of the courtyard circled by people in camping chairs. We plodded round after our host, disoriented by the darkness and uneven ground after another day spent sat in the car. On the walls of the main house hung large, skillful paintings of the owners and in our hands were small delicate glasses filled with sweet cherry wine. The chambers of each glass were insulated with thickly reinforced elongated necks, “perfect for dancing or falling asleep with” and not having a cherry stain to show for it. Fortunately, we kept the little packaged food we could get from Beocin in the car. Instead, we dined on gourmet vegan food, a culinary experiment made in anticipation of a group of future guests, an Indonesian dish inspired by our host’s father who was a Dutchman born in the former-colony. After the meal, we drifted back through landscaped islands of vegetation to join the campfire and find out how two ex-Londoners had come to own such an enchanted place.'},
      {content: 'A South-East Londoner by birth, Vivien is half Serbian and met Kilki whilst both were studying for a Masters at Rada. Coming into a small sum of money gave them pause for thought, enough for a down payment on a London house. They found a home in Serbia instead: a farmhouse with an acre of land in a small valley and an intimate, self-reliant community. Across the street stands a tap for fresh water, an unassuming shop opens each day next door, selling local staples and at the end of the road is the rebuilt Orthodox Serbian Church that was once reduced to ash by a German occupation. Behind this is a well-spaced plum orchard, where the skins are dark and the fruit honey-orange. They have an adorable piglet, several chickens and 54 cherry trees that cling to the hillside, reaching upward from the back of the garden and producing a surplus of sweet brandy-wine. Practicing permaculture, establishing a retreat for acting schools and feeling smug about not living out London’s grind was how we found them. Envious is how we left them. They pumped our pock-marked tires and charted our next course, setting us to cut through the gorges of Bosnia until we were in the warm embrace of the Mediterranean climes and within arm’s reach of Adriatic coastal indulgence. But first, a swim.'},
      {content: 'It was the middle of the day as we set off and the sun beat down as we pulled into the empty make-shift car park. Two trendy women posed for selfies next to the quarry’s edge before vanishing and a portly local man was getting back into his clothes as we arrived. Minutes later Tom sat entranced in a man-made cove, tiny fish feasting on his toes, just as Kilka promised there would be, “an experience highly sought at most London retreats”. But this quarry-cum-spa was not so disused. Across the milky waters, a sole yellow JCB bulldozer slalomed mechanically back and forth, high above on a plateau. Shelving any prudish health concerns and following a rudimentary depth-check, we dove in.'},
      {content: 'As a final reminder from Serbia that we were no longer in the EU, each of us received texts to politely notify us that we were hemorrhaging money in phone bills and that the data of Google maps now cost a pound a mile, we made the bold decision to operate offline. A mere 30 minutes later we came to regret this. We’d been carefully tracing the road along the Drina river to our new landmark, the town of Zvornik. Turning our phones back on to double-check our progress it became quickly apparent that Zvornik is on both sides of the river and then it became obvious why there were no bridges. The side we wanted was actually in Bosnia.'}

      {content: 'We are in the slip of a valley in the late afternoon, humming along, in amongst another convoy. The light is gentle and a warm breeze runs through the car. The last stickiness of a Hungarian beer that exploded on opening is now drying, smattered across the dashboard. Bosnia seems like Serbia. But wait, maybe not. A man is reading in a plastic chair in the shade of an apple tree. Small fires are lit and tended to next to private patches of sweetcorn behind homes. Green flags of Islam flutter from spires not minarets and church steeples dot the views from the roadside. A horse is tethered by chain in someones front yard. The ominous haystacks not seen since Slovakia are here again, repeating in the fields that we roll by. Lorries fully stacked with logs fill the road, rumbling past, always going the other way. We pass a factory for pre-fabricated, cookie-cutter housing.'},
      {content: 'Ever rising, the road meanders, flitting between dense forest and open meadow. We’re pulled up and round the side of a mountain. On one bend are a number of cars parked and their drivers huddle. Each holds a plastic bottle as they crouch near the mouth of a cave, trying to collect water as it trickles forth from a hidden spring. We stop for a moment, hopping out to investigate this unusual scene and hoping to grab a last glimpse of the valley below us, hidden through the trees. Up a nearby path there is still no vantage point, the foliage too dense. Instead I find a cascade of fly-tipping, strewn over the mountain’s edge - a plush orange sofa lays broken in two parts, its off-colour tassels still clinging to it.'},
      {content: 'The mountain is a climatic pocket, a dividing line that leads us into the lasting summer of the Mediterranean and its thick humid air. The coniferous trees dissipate but just as we drop from one mountain we ascend the narrow roads of another. The roads cling to a rock face and are fraught with blind corners; we bob in and out of hill side shade in the early afternoon as we enter the valley of Sarajevo. We stop for a brief moment on the rim of the Sarajevo basin and creep over someone’s garden wall to peer in at the sprawling city below.'},
      {content: 'We skirted through commuter traffic, riding ring roads until we were out the other side of the city. The experience was transient and detached, empty of prospects and potentialities and ultimately ignorant of the place’s culture and history. When I read of the devastation of the ’92 to ’96 siege and wonder if I even visited Sarajevo at all. There’s an image of the tower-block of Parliament: impotent and ablaze, depressed as the geography of the landscape, flames bursting from its innards and licking its white panelled outer. Citizens below, snipers above. When the siege ended, the concrete scars caused by mortar shell explosions left marks that were filled with red resin. The resulting floral patterns led to them being dubbed Sarajevo Roses.'},
      {content: 'We were aiming for Stari Most as we set off that morning from Serbia, convinced that we would be pencil diving off the side of its famous bridge, swimming trunks wedgie-ing us in precious moments before a whip-crack sound of our bodies piercing the crystal water surface and slipping into the river’s current below. Instead, as we pressed on from Sarajevo, the sunlight was slowly choked between rocky walls as we crept further into a gorge and we decided that the town of Konjic would mark the end of the day’s drive.'},
      {content: 'Drawing closer to Konjic, the road winds tighter to the bends of the river. On one corner was an older gentleman, snug in a sleeveless, off-brown fishing jacket, a white sunhat tight to his forehead. He presided over two tables with glass jars stacked three high. The jars possessed a golden glow with the dying light filtering through their contents.'},
      {content: 'We’d seen similar sights throughout North-Eastern Europe, people selling distinctive yellow chanterelle mushrooms. Their punnets passed in a smeary haze, as did their sellers: dour faced grandparents hunched in the rain aside the motorway or chubby madames, each sat in an upturned wheelbarrow, the same they’d used to transport their goods to the village roadside that morning. Never did we see anyone buying anything. Rarely was there even a place to stop.'},
      {content: 'This man stood apart. He seemed more love-labouring hobbyist than businessman. Nestled in the bend of the road, behind him stretched a freshly cut lawn and lush forestry, a private chalk-dusted road leading to an inviting home. Tom swaggered to the table, potentially the old fellow’s first customer of the day. By the time I’d fished out a few Bosnian marks and sauntered over, the man was holding one hand aloft. Pumping the muscle of his forearm to make a fist and then unfurling each finger, the sequence formed a price for the items picked - a dark two litre bottle of juice and a glass jar darker still, with contents three tones blacker than your average honey. We paid quickly and thanked him before cruising off, back down the gorge.'},
      {content: 'Back in the passenger seat, overwhelmed by a desire to try local produce and a boredom from hours in the car, Tom tore the lid off the juice and eagerly pressed the large bottle to his lips. Never one for half measures, he took a hearty glug of the fluid obscured in dark plastic and by the time a taste registered his mouth was full; Full with a harsh apple cider vinegar trickling into his throat, a bitter acidity causing his cheeks to contract. He thrust his head out the window before an eruption bursts from his mouth, blasting an auburn liquid down the side of the car. Then he graciously offered us each a sip. The “honey” taste like shit too.'},
      {content: 'Konjic is a sleepy town, despite what all the stylish teenagers want it to be. They sit with shisha curling from their lips and branded soft drinks in their hands. The centre piece is a beautiful bridge and a river runs gently through, the water clear and glacial. Craggy mountains provide a stunning backdrop. At one end of the cobbled bridge is an ornate white mosque with a black spire. A final call to prayer rings out across a neat cemetery. We have the worst meal of the trip.'},
      {content: 'Despite all the signs for a waterfall the land is arid. The only towns signed for are wise enough to cling to the river and Stari Most is no exception. It’s smug. Old but prosperous, historical and beautiful, traditional and touristy. We park on a double yellow, swimming trunks at the ready. It is said to be a right of passage but surely only mad men jump off its bridge. People have died. Its 20 metres high and iron postings stop anyone from getting a good footing to spring from. Looking over the side, it’s not obvious where you’d land. We capitulate soon after doing so, chickening out at the vital moment. A shopkeeper later tells me a German lady made the jump early that morning. We get back on the road before another parking ticket and singe our backs on the roasting leather seats.'},
      {content: 'Kravica is a tufa cascade in a rich riparian ecosystem. That it overgrows with moss is a good thing, this symbiosis means more tufa. Found in Bosnia’s karstic heartland what more would you expect. “Karst is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves” and “tufa is a variety of limestone formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of ambient temperature water.”'},
      {content: 'Of course we didn’t know any of this. Maps be damned we just followed the thousand billboard signs to the oasis, wondering how much the entry fee would be if they’d spent so much on advertising. More men were selling “honey” and we got to find out that one of the items we quaffed and hastily spat out before Konjic was in fact tree sap. The place is rammed with tourists and the waterfall’s discharge is summertime low. It’s maybe a little more swampy than the billboards suggested but we can attest to the water’s “ambient temperature” and little can detract from the tranquility at the fall’s crown. Small clear pools fill and swirl in amongst tree roots before their contents are continually emptied over an eroding edge. Down below you can swim in amongst more than twenty individual falls as each bursts from foliage above. Clambering up over slippery, rivulet covered rocks we dive-bombed into the latent refreshment of a plunge pool.'},
      {content: 'It’s hot again. We wind through scrubland, glancing potholes. The beamer’s holding together and without rain the driver’s brain is less addled with anxiety, calmed by each corner successfully turned, goaded by the prospect of the Mediterranean. After 5 days of driving, the sea is now tantalisingly close. Poland is almost a fading memory. We drop down into the cleft of a deep canyon. Its walls encase us. The car feels fragile and lost in the space, dwarfed by the enormity of its surroundings. Out the canyon’s other side we’re within arms reach of the shore.'},
      {content: 'Croatia is but another minor flirtation, Montenegro will provide the main set-piece in our Adriatic episode. The coastal road bobs the car up and down as we swoop over bays, drift in and out of placid coves. The crystal water of the Adriatic reflects sunlight into the car and beams of light dance across the ceiling. The sea is set with traps and expanses of fishing net. Vibrantly coloured buoys demarcate each plot, each strung and spaced equally, changing perspective makes orderly lines of buoys appear like jewels in a flamboyant necklace. Fishermen idle on cement jetties, a stretch of fabric above providing each some respite from the sun, collapsable wooden-top tables are assembled nearby, primed for the gutting of fish.'}
