      { content: 'We take a cab across London in the early Thursday morning darkness and make our flight to Estonia; on arrival we rush over to a lot near Tallinn airport recommended by the rally’s organisers. With a budget of just 750 euros, a graveyard of broken windscreens, punctured tyres and unregistered vehicles awaited us. But in this rough, past a dozen deformed hatchbacks and a promising people carrier, lay our diamond: a crusty black BMW 3 series with a chassis so low to the ground that not even the lithest limbo dancer could not make it under the thing. The vehicle was personally maintained by the garage owner’s lackey; following its resurrection from the scrapheap he’d installed strobe headlights and filled the boot with the spoils of fishing trips but, critically he’d removed its suspension and as a result each unannounced bump in the road had become a symbol of sabotage, threatening wanton destruction of the undercarriage. A few late arrivals were circling though, eyeing up our car, and with time running out we said our prayers and sealed the deal on our mobile home to-be. From one Saturday to the next this vehicle had to carry the three of us, feckless mechanics toting a dummies guide to auto-repair, from coast to coast; from Tallinn in Estonia to Thessaloniki in Greece. As we left the garage, another team were huddled round their newly purchased Mercedes E Class, trying to stop a flow of coolant as it sprayed onto the tarmac. ' },
      { content: 'Saturday morning. Everyone assembled in a pothole riddled carpark off the Estonian equivalent of the M4. Ten cracked-up cars parked bumper-to-bumper. Each reprobate team applied racing stripes and whispered final blessings to their motors. A golden VW Passat ambled into the lot, the team had to ask for a jump start from some kindly Estonian en route. A people carrier careens and donuts around and out of the starting gates. '},
      { content: 'About fifty hours of driving lay ahead as we set off from that carpark. Looking on a map, with a big cross through Russia, a decision would be needed as we came to the bottom of Poland. We could either go left, through the patchwork quilt of countries behind the Tatra mountains on the Polish-Slovakian border or go right, also encountering the Carpathian mountain range but navigating the bulks of Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria before ending in Greece.'},
      { content: 'Before the trip, my expectations had been set high by a book by Patrick Leigh Fermour, the biography of a teen Englishman walking from England to Istanbul in a time before the First World War. Each page helped gloss over our use of Google Maps with a romantic patina. I imagined the Habsburg high life; counts would invite us into their castles and hospitable shepherds bid us to shelter in their huts. In contrast to this idyll were stories from a book tracing European history at the dawn of the EU’s creation; - stories from the Second World and Yugoslav War and anecdotes from Tom about the copious amount of vicious stray dogs in rural Romania. On a recent trip he’d been handed a homemade club to carry at all times.'},
      { content: 'We enjoyed a meal in the dark that first evening, eating delicious, indiscernible food at a place we had somehow arrived at after muffled phone calls and reference from a potential host’s friend-of-a-friend. Coming up the drive we peered in through the glass of the nearest building to find a wedding in full swing, its audience rapt, listening in silence to speeches. Sneaking around the back of the building in search of our host we instead bumped into the apron-clad catering staff of the event. After minor explanation of our appearance a makeshift table was erected and we were brought steaming hot plates from the weddings menu, the hospitality even extending to a 2litre bottle of an apple-mint juice I won’t be recommending.' },
      { content: 'We breathed a few short sighs of relief in the night air of Northern Poland, a show of solemnity after our day’s drive. We’d made good progress, blitzing three countries in a single day, but the way the beamer had handled had certainly given us pause for thought. The car aquaplaned several times on the sodden roads of Lithuania and in the downpour earlier that afternoon we had been slung unannounced into the oncoming traffic of a roundabout. Without time to press the horn we could but stare exasperated and wide-eyed at the approaching driver; yet only an expressionless old face peered back at us from behind the steering wheel as we skid out the nearest exit, the tyres somehow finding a newly poignant traction on the wet road.' },
      { content: 'At sunrise, people were still dancing in the morning mist. We snuck out as they went to bed and plucked a few apples from the roadside before settling back into the car. Driving through the small and empty town nearby, we recognised one of the catering staff who had kindly served us the night before. In the next village we swapped Zloty for some yogurt and drank hastily from the pot. Several ornate church spires passed us by before we left the town behind and started out on another big day of driving; roads undulated through fields dotted with cows before turning into unworn tarmac tracks through regimented woodland. The car seemed thankful for the dry smooth roads.  The rest of Poland passed slowly, with heavy rainfall and an unreliable set of tyres we stuck to the motorways, avoiding major cities and high speeds, the aquaplaning of the day before fresh in our minds.' },
      { content: 'It was still raining as we approached the valleys of Slovakia. Abandoned by skiers for the season, the locals met us with mixed emotions. We dug into more rich, hard-to-classify food: dumplings doused in gravy, a potato outer housing pockets of tender pork meat. Bells clanged loudly in the pastures as cows grazed and hay stacks loomed ominously; spaced out, stale grass, standing tall as people in the fields, unlike the tightly wrapped, neat cylinders from the fields of home. We crossed back over the Polish border in search of petrol and what is known as the \“Eye of the Sea\” - a series of highland lakes called Morskie Oko, which we were naive enough to think we could drive up to. Grateful for the lack of rain, the brisk swim and cup of borscht that awaited us at the top, after 4 hours of hiking we arrived back at the car.' },
      { content: 'Soon the peaks of the Tatra mountains were silhouetted by the last of the sunlight, framed in the plastic-glass side mirror as we drove onto the flatlands of Slovakia and the enveloping evening darkness of Hungary. Beside the Slovakian motorway sat a vast off-white castle, towering over the landscape in the twilight. With its semi-literal ivory towers dwarfing the town, it was hard not to project a mental image-reel of medieval and knightly scenes, a romantic idea in contrast to the feudal history of the surroundings.' },
      { content: 'I tried out my camcorder a little more in Hungary. On a morning walk alone, I filmed flowers on roadside bushes and the warm morning light bathing the buildings, an old lady ambled through a residential neighbourhood. Zooming in on an orchid in someone’s window, a curtain is abruptly drawn back and a topless man starts wildly gesticulating at me. He swung his arms manically through the air, throwing Hungarian syllables over his barbed wire fence before I put the camera away, failing to record any of it. Back at the homestay, the Ladies Youth Olympic boxing is on and a young Hungarian lady is battering her opponent. We hit the road.'},
      { content: 'All countries mentioned so far are members of the Schengen agreement. This means there is freedom of movement, no stop-and-checks just smooth sailing over land that to the unknowing eye looks quite the same. This also means that we were yet to have requirement to get out passports or fret over whether border force would inform us that the car we had bought so hastily at such a good price was stolen or that its hubcaps were stuffed with heroin. Of course, all these paranoiac thoughts now surfaced as we approached the Serbian border, our first hard stop, but uneventfully neither the Hungarian or Serbian border force questioned our modus operandi.'},
      { content: 'Following a recommendation for a place to swim we pulled up to the lakeside. Thick-green algae bunched at the surface, shiny in the midday sun. Young boys ran on concrete paths, chasing each other around the lake’s uneven circumference and a few rowing boats chugged along its turgid surface. Maybe we’d swim after lunch instead. We finally finished the jar of “pattisons” - ridged-oval and lurid-white pickles - that had been sloshing around on every turned corner with us since Estonia. For the rest of the day we cruised pretty steadily through flat, yellow pastures, botching overtakes of lorries on single track main roads until we met sudden urbanity once again. A wrought iron bridge stretched out before us. From a vantage point across the river we admired what we hadn’t realised was Novi Sad, then, with the light fading, rushed on to more accomodation found hastily online.'},
      { content: 'The \“Balkan Retreat\” is nestled in the Fruška Gora national park, tucked behind hills and surrounded by forest. So we were a little bemused when we called to find a lady from South-East London on the other end of the phone. She told us of a town nearby to grab some supplies before arriving and missing the first turning, we circled back on the town of Beocin[MOU1] . *The nucleus a cement factory, we drove in parallel up a quiet, straight road. To our left people in crumbling houses left their doors ajar. Men played cards and drank at a table in the humid open air by the corner shop. The buildings were all a dusty pink. The dying light outlined half-functioning silos and cement mills before we met the darkness of the national park and quickly took a wrong turn.'},
      {content: 'There was a fire in the middle of the courtyard circled by people in camping chairs. We plodded round after our host, disoriented by the darkness and uneven ground after another day spent sat in the car. On the walls of the main house hung large, skillful paintings of the owners and in our hands were small delicate glasses filled with sweet cherry wine, the chambers of which were insulated with thickly reinforced long necks, “perfect for dancing or falling asleep with” and not having a cherry stain to show for it.  Fortunately we kept the little packaged food we could get from Beocin in the car. Instead, we dined on gourmet vegan food, a culinary experiment made in anticipation of a group of future guests, an Indonesian dish inspired by our host’s father who was a Dutchman born in the former-colony. After the meal, we drifted back through landscaped islands of vegetation to join the campfire and find out how two ex-Londoners had come to own such an enchanted place.'},
      {content: 'A South-East Londoner by birth, Vivien is half Serbian and met Kilki whilst both were studying for a masters at Rada. Coming into a small sum of money gave them pause for thought, enough for a down payment on a London house. They found a home in Serbia instead. A farmhouse with an acre of land in a small valley and an intimate, self-reliant community. Across the street stands a tap for fresh water, an unassuming shop opens each day next door, selling local staples and at the end of the road is the rebuilt Orthodox Serbian Church that was once reduced to ash by a German occupation, behind which is a well-spaced plum orchard, the skins dark and the fruit honey-orange. They have an adorable piglet, several chickens and 54 cherry trees clinging to the hillside that reaches upward from the back of the garden and produces a surplus of cherry-wine. Practicing permaculture, establishing a retreat for acting schools and feeling smug about not living out London’s grind was how we found them. Envious is how we left them. They pumped our pock-marked tires and charted our next course, setting us to cut through the gorges of Bosnia until we were in the warm embrace of the Mediterranean climes and within arm’s reach of Adriatic coastal indulgence. But first, a swim.'},
      {content: 'It was the middle of the day as we set off and the sun beat down as we pulled into the empty make-shift car park. Two trendy women posed for selfies next to the quarry’s edge before vanishing and a portly local man was getting back into his clothes as we arrived. Minutes later Tom sat entranced in a man-made cove, tiny fish feasting on his toes, just as Kilka promised there would be, “an experience highly sought at most London retreats”. But this quarry-cum-spa was not so dis-used. Across the milky waters, a sole yellow JCB bulldozer slalomed mechanically back and forth, high above on a plateau. Shelving any prudish health concerns and following a rudimentary depth-check we dove in.'},
      {content: 'As a final reminder from Serbia that we were no longer in the EU, each of us received texts to politely notify us that we were hemorrhaging money in phone bills and that the data of Google maps now cost a pound a mile; we made the bold decision to operate offline. A mere 30 minutes later we came to regret this. We’d been carefully tracing the road along the Drina river to our new landmark, the town of Zvornik. Turning our phones back on to double-check our progress it became quickly apparent that Zvornik is on both sides of the river and then it became obvious why there were no bridges. The side we wanted was actually in Bosnia.'}
